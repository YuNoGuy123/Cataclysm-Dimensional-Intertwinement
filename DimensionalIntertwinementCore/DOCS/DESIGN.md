# Lore vs Dark Days Ahead
This is the main lore of Dimensional Intertwinement, Core will follow this lore as best it can.

In essence, all of the other mods in this series also follow this same lore except for the differences that each mod adds unto it, or to put it more simply, this lore is designed to be modular and not very strict.

### Science vs Dark Days Ahead
I have a very firm opinion that Dark Days Ahead was more fun when it was more focused on science fiction. 

As such, we are to imagine the world as one which is close to our own, but with progressive technology in our lives beyond what we normally see. 

Minireactor vehicles are brought back in extremely tight quantities, quantum solar panels exist again, the RM121 is unremoved, and so on. 

It's worth noting that while these things are considered to be coming back, more things in line with that old standard will as well. Additionally, with new items for players to use, new enemies for players to fight will arrive as well.

### Balance vs Dark Days Ahead
I am going for an experience which will feature stronger enemies than vanilla Dark Days Ahead to match up with the increased power that will be available to the player.

Some enemies may become stronger, some weapons may become weaker, it depends on how I slice it.

### Content Quality vs Dark Days Ahead
Everything that is included with this mod should be something that *could've* been in Dark Days Ahead if it had a more science fiction oriented lore.

I'll do my best to adhere to this, but I can't always guarantee that this is how it'll be.

# Footnotes
This is a very early and rough writing, basically just bullet points, it'll be expanded with time.
