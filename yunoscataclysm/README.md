## This mod is still heavy WIP.

What that means is there is a lot that I still need to fix up. Right now Jasden's home is literally just the LMOE Shelter but without the underground area.
I want people to be able to watch this mod grow with time, this mod is definitely a very ambitious project.
Named NPCs, with strong lore to accompany all of them, new weapons, monsters, items, etc etc.

Hell! I even thought of putting Okegom in here somewhere, though, I decided against it because that would be a multiple-year long project.

Please be patient with me, if you want to report issues, do so at https://github.com/YuNoGuy123/YuNoGuy123sCataclysm

Beyond that, things happen with time around here!
