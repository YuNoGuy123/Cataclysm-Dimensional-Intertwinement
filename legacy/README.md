# (THIS IS THE OLD VERSION OF THE README)

# YuNo's Cataclysm: Revitalized
## This mod is not considered to be "released" yet, simply on github as a way for me to track progress and showcase what I am doing.

For almost *4 years now* I've been wanting to make a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that would be able to add content into the game that is fun, novel, and anti-vanilla all while trying to remain balanced closely to vanilla, and having a sensible lore to it.

I would always get somewhere, but stop due to school, or other projects, or issues with the game as a whole. However, Now I am actually here to work on something for myself, as an *actual* side project, the way it should've been anyways.

This is to be considered a complete restart on the mod, effectively everything has been redone and I think it's for the best since for the most part the old version of the mod wasn't very functional anyways.

This mod is open to contributions, simply read through the documentation folder and follow the (very loose) guidelines, additionally, I am looking to change the name of this mod to something else, if anyone out there is better with names than I am, let me know! :^)


When restarting this mod - I initially was going to make it a Bright Nights mod, however, I feel like Bright Nights is far behind compared to Dark Days Ahead when it comes to modding, and as such, for the time being, there won't be a Bright Nights version.


Thank you, and have a great day!

## Summary.

A mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that adds many "things" to the Cataclysm, weather they be items, weapons, armors, NPCs, enemies, magical abilities, and I could go on.

The mod is most closely related to other mods such as Cataclysm++, Magiclysm, and Aftershock, as this mod is (in some capacity) inspired by all of those.

The mod is being designed to be played with the previously mentioned Magiclysm, the mod will work without it (for now), however, some of the features in this mod will require Magiclysm later in the future.

There are plans for a version of the mod which does not require Magiclysm later on down the line (or depending how I slice it, such a thing may be unnecessary).


Current mod version - 1.0.0 - "Revival"

Confirmed working as of game version - Experimental Build 2024-03-12-2129.

## Contributing.

I would absolutely love to include other people in this mod, weather that be a character of yours, a magic artifact you've designed, whatever! My goal here is to create a mod that can include several people in it, if it's possible in Dark Days Ahead, if you're willing to help add it, and you're willing to follow these guidelines, chances are it can indeed be added to the mod!

As I've previously eluded to, these are simply guidelines, **they are not hard rules.** If you have a strong reason for adding something, and the addition itself is strong, I am extremely unlikely to say no to your contribution, even if it goes against one or more of these guidelines. I do not want anyone to be discouraged, but I do want to keep the mod generally coherent throughout.

### 1. Stick to the theme and lore.

I would like to keep the mod somewhat serious, even if we do include things from many sources, I want to ensure that the things that are included are somewhat grounded in the "reality" that we have here. That means sticking to the theme, and the lore. You may read the lore [here.](https://github.com/YuNoGuy123/YuNoGuy123sCataclysm/blob/exp/yunoscataclysmrevitalized/DOCS/LORE.md)

If you're a contributor, don't think that all your contributions have to align perfectly with the lore, this is more of a guideline rather than a hard rule and I am willing to hand-wave minor things in favor of enjoyability. However, major things must adhere to the lore, I am willing to alter some portions of the lore if I like a contribution enough, but regardless, major additions should attempt to stick to what's established as best as possible.


**Example of a contribution that is okay per this guideline:**

Adding a new enemy that expands an already existing enemy faction, the story of the enemy easily fits into the story of the rest of the enemy faction and does not have any conflicting reasons as to why it shouldn't exist.

**Example of a contribution that is also okay, but bends the guidline slightly:**

Adding a new ranged energy type weapon which is capable of dealing high damage in a small form factor, and isn't too rare, but the weapon has some type of major usability issue preventing it from being too far ahead of the lore.

**Example of a contribution that is also okay, but needs a lore addition to be included:**

Adding a new enemy faction (in general). This would need some writing to go along with it to fit it in with the rest of the factions that are already in the game.


Basically, so long as you can justify the existence of your contribution by using already existing lore, or establishing some new part of lore, it will be fine as per this guideline.

### 2. Stick to the balance goals of the mod.

[TODO: figure out what I actually want for the balance of this mod]

### 3. Be reasonable with content.

I am perfectly okay with references to other sources of media, however, references that are too blatant, too memey, or just aren't a good fit for the mod may not be a good idea.

Additionally, your original content is perfectly fine, even if it wasn't made for this mod, so long as you're willing to put up with me asking you many, many questions about your character, for instance, so long as they can reasonably fit in with the rest of the game world, they can be added. 

As a last point to this guideline, please try to refrain from naming other sources of media in your contribution, if it's something you made then it's fine of course, but copyrighted media is copyrighted everywhere, even in a free-to-play open source mod.


**Example of a contribution that is okay as per this guideline:**

You want to add a new NPC based off an OC of yours, the OC is human, does not have any particularly extraordinary abilities, and is interesting enough to warrant their existence either as a loner, or within an existing faction.

**Example of a contribution that is also okay, but bends the guideline slightly:**

You want to add a subtle reference to a popular anime series, the reference is in the form of a book included in the game world and is titled something akin to "Wacky Escapade", this is a reference that anyone who looked twice would understand, but I would be okay with it since we aren't naming anything specifically and it would not hurt the quality of the mod to be included.

**Example of a contribution that you'd better have a VERY good reason for implementing:**

You want to add a new NPC based off an OC of yours, the OC is a non-human dragon-scalie, as tall as a building, and extremely powerful even on their own. This is difficult to justify given the theme and content of the rest of the mod, I'm not saying you couldn't justify it, but I would be impressed if your justification managed to convince me.


This in essence is very similar to point 1, though, something like having a dragon-scalie in the mod is technically feasible considering the lore. The issue is there wouldn't be any content that fits with it, it would stick out really badly. So it's important to make sure something doesn't stick out too much.
