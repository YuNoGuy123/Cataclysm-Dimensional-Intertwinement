# Dimensional Intertwinement - A suite of various content mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Dimensional Intertwinement is a series of mods designed to work together, each of which adding a significant amount of content to the game, the different mods are all compatible with one another and can be mixed and matched to add content of your liking.

Previously known as "YuNoGuy123's Cataclysm" before I changed the name to something a little bit less ridiculous.

## Dimensional Intertwinement - Core 
The most basic form of the mod, currently not required by the others but *may* end up being required in the future.

Aims to restore the science fiction elements that were present in previous versions of Dark Days Ahead, and expand upon them.

## Dimensional Intertwinement - Magic
Requires Magiclysm.

Functions as an expansion to Magiclysm, adding more magic and more "stuff" in general.

# Some questions that I figure may be asked are pre-emptively answered below

## Will this suite have more mods in the future?
Probably, yeah! Though it depends a lot on how much I end up making out of this. Currently "Core" and "Magic" are the only ones planned, but I've had ideas for other possibilities.

## Is the suite compatible with other mods?
Compatibility with other mods is best effort and not guaranteed, if there is an incompatibility and it is a simple fix, I will fix it, otherwise, that mod may simply be incompatible.

## Can we add X/Y/Z to Core if it was removed from DDA?
Probably, yeah. A lot of the current plans for Core are just things that were removed from DDA.

No guarantees, though.

## Will any of this be in-repo someday?
I doubt it.

# Footnotes
This README is currently undergoing a rewrite so I've only put the bare minimum information here.

Additionally, the entire suite is undergoing a complete facelift, and nothing is really available for use yet.

The current name, Dimensional Intertwinement, is not final and *may* change if I come up with something better, I suck at names though so we'll see.
