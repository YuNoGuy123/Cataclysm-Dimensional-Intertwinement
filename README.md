# Dimensional Intertwinement - A Sci-Fi/Magic content mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

A varied content mod primarily aiming to restore some of the earlier science fiction elements of DDA.

This mod is not designed to be played with Aftershock and there might be some conflicts there.

This README is currently undergoing a rewrite so I've only put the bare minimum information here.


The current name, Dimensional Intertwinement, is not final and *may* change if I come up with something better, I suck at names though so we'll see.

The plan is that there will be two mods in this repositry, "Dimensional Intertwinement - Core" and "Dimensional Intertwinement - Magic" the core mod will just be the Sci-Fi stuff, but the magic version will have optional expansions to Magiclysm.

There may be more packs to add onto the mod in the future, but they'll all require the core pack.

Originally this mod was going to have all of the themes be combined but I've decided that some people may not be into that so they'll be separate mods.

No, I am not planning for this mod to be included in the DDA repo. Not that it meets the criteria for that regardless as it messes with other mods.
