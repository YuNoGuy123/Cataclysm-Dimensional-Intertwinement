# Dimensional Intertwinement - A suite of various content mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Dimensional Intertwinement is a series of mods (hereby referred to as "content packs") designed to work together, each of which adding a significant amount of content to the game, the different content packs are all compatible with one another and can be mixed and matched to add content of your liking.

Previously known as "YuNoGuy123's Cataclysm" before I changed the name to something a little bit less ridiculous.

## Dimensional Intertwinement - Core 
The most basic form of the mod, currently not required by the other packs but *may* end up being required in the future.

Aims to restore the science fiction elements that were present in previous versions of Dark Days Ahead, and expand upon them.

## Dimensional Intertwinement - Magic
Requires Magiclysm.

Functions as an expansion to Magiclysm, adding more magic and more "stuff" in general.

# Footnotes
This README is currently undergoing a rewrite so I've only put the bare minimum information here.

Additionally, the entire suite is undergoing a complete facelift, and nothing is really available for use yet.

The current name, Dimensional Intertwinement, is not final and *may* change if I come up with something better, I suck at names though so we'll see.

Currently there are only two content packs planned, "Core" and "Magic" but in the future I will likely make more depending on how things go.

Originally this mod was going to have all of the themes be combined but I've decided that some people may not be into that so they'll be separate.

Compatibility with other mods is best effort and not guaranteed, mods like Aftershock will probably not work with the mod.

No, I am not planning for any of this to be included in the DDA repo. Not that it meets the criteria for that regardless as it messes with other mods and is a multi-suite set of mods which I don't think would go down well, I would probably have to take the best elements and combine them.
