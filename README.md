# Dimensional Intertwinement - A suite of various content mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Dimensional Intertwinement is a series of mods designed to work together, each of which adding a significant amount of content to the game, the different mods are all compatible with one another and can be mixed and matched to add content of your liking.

Previously known as "YuNoGuy123's Cataclysm" before I changed the name to something a little bit less ridiculous.

## Dimensional Intertwinement - Core 
The most basic form of the mod, currently not required by the others but *may* end up being required in the future.

Aims to restore the science fiction elements that were present in previous versions of Dark Days Ahead, and expand upon them.

## Dimensional Intertwinement - Magic
Requires Magiclysm.

Functions as an expansion to Magiclysm, adding more magic and more "stuff" in general.

# Some questions that I figure may be asked are pre-emptively answered below

### Will this suite have more mods in the future?
Probably, yeah! Though it depends a lot on how much I end up making out of this. Currently "Core" and "Magic" are the only ones planned, but I've had ideas for other possibilities.

### Is the suite compatible with other major mods?
Compatibility with other big mods is best effort and not guaranteed, if there is an incompatibility and it is a simple fix, I will fix it, otherwise, that mod may simply be incompatible.

Aftershock is probably the most likely mod to be rendered incompatible with Core, although with [this PR](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/76632) the theoretical incompatibility should be easily fixable. 

### Can we add X/Y/Z to Core if it was removed from DDA?
Probably, yeah. A lot of the current plans for Core are just things that were removed from DDA.

No guarantees, though.

### Will any of this be in-repo someday?
I doubt it, the problem being that these mods are designed to be mixed and matched, if you like one part of it, then you play with that part, if you like another part, then you can play with that part as well. 

If this were to go into repo, it'd have to be consolidated down into one mod with a singular intention, and I don't really want to do that. 

The only way this would ever happen would be if I *needed* C++ code in order to do something I reaaally wanted to do with the mod, currently I can't imagine anything like that.

### Are these mods lore friendly?
"Magic" is more or less lore friendly to (and designed to be played with) Magiclysm yeah.

"Core"? Oh heavens, no. Though I will try to break the monotony of the lore in a fun and interesting way where possible.

### Bright Nights?
I doubt it, Bright Nights just *isn't* there yet. It's close, but not quite.

If Bright Nights ends up adding an improved version of the proficiencies system (I like proficiencies but they could be way better), separate tileset for the overmap, more content, pockets, etc then I will likely end up making this a Bright Nights mod suite.

# Footnotes
This README is currently undergoing a rewrite so I've only put the bare minimum information here.

Additionally, the entire suite is undergoing a complete facelift, and nothing is really available for use yet.

The current name, Dimensional Intertwinement, is not final and *may* change if I come up with something better, I suck at names though so we'll see.
