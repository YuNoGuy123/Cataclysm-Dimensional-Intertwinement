# Dimensional Intertwinement - A Sci-Fi/Magic content mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

A varied content mod primarily aiming to restore some of the earlier science fiction elements of DDA.

This mod is not designed to be played with Aftershock and there might be some conflicts there.

This README is currently undergoing a rewrite so I've only put the bare minimum information here.


The current name, Dimensional Intertwinement, is not final and *may* change if I come up with something better, I suck at names though so we'll see.

The plan is that there will be two mods in this repositry, "Dimensional Intertwinement - Core" and "Dimensional Intertwinement - Magic" the core mod will just be the Sci-Fi stuff, but the magic version will have optional expansions to Magiclysm.

Originally this mod was going to have the Sci-Fi and magic elements be combined but I've decided that some people may not be into that so they'll be separate mods.
