# YuNo's Cataclysm: Revitalized
## This mod is not considered to be "released" yet, simply on github as a way for me to track progress and showcase what I am doing.

For almost *4 years now* I've been wanting to make a mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that would be able to add content into the game that is fun, novel, and anti-vanilla all while trying to remain balanced closely to vanilla, and having a sensible lore to it.

I would always get somewhere, but stop due to school, or other projects, or issues with the game as a whole. However, Now I am actually here to work on something for myself, as an *actual* side project, the way it should've been anyways.

This is to be considered a complete restart on the mod, effectively everything has been redone and I think it's for the best since for the most part the old version of the mod wasn't very functional anyways.

This mod is open to contributions, simply read through the documentation folder and follow the (very loose) guidelines, additionally, I am looking to change the name of this mod to something else, if anyone out there is better with names than I am, let me know! :^)


When restarting this mod - I initially was going to make it a Bright Nights mod, however, I feel like Bright Nights is far behind compared to Dark Days Ahead when it comes to modding, and as such, for the time being, there won't be a Bright Nights version.


Thank you, and have a great day!

## Summary

A mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that adds many "things" to the Cataclysm, weather they be items, weapons, armors, NPCs, enemies, magical abilities, and I could go on.

The mod is most closely related to other mods such as Cataclysm++, Magiclysm, and Aftershock, as this mod is (in some capacity) inspired by all of those.

The mod is being designed to be played with the previously mentioned Magiclysm, the mod will work without it (for now), however, some of the features in this mod will require Magiclysm later in the future.

There are plans for a version of the mod which does not require Magiclysm later on down the line (or depending how I slice it, such a thing may be unnecessary).


Current mod version - 1.0.0 - "Revival"

Confirmed working as of game version - Experimental Build 2024-03-12-2129.
