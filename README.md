## This is a legacy mod!

The current version of the mod that you see here on GitHub is to be considered legacy. I've restarted the mod more or less from scratch (not that it really matters, there was very little actually done). 
Weather or not I'll use GitHub for future versions of the mod is still an unknown to me. I haven't checked to see if the current version of the mod even works with current builds (although it probably does due to it being such a simple mod).

## Summary

A mod for cataclysm dark days ahead that adds many unique/mythical/weird things to the cataclysm.
This mod is not intended for vanilla purists or players that want a completely easily comprehensive experience, weird things will happen a lot, this mod is still balanced around vanilla though, do not expect anything that is overpowered.
This mod is currently very early and this is my first C:DDA mod.

Current mod version - 1.0.1

Confirmed working as of game version - EXP Build c5ae888
