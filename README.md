# YuNoGuy123sCataclysm
A mod for cataclysm dark days ahead that adds many unique/mythical/weird things to the cataclysm.
This mod is not intended for vanilla purists or players that want a completely easily comprehensive experience, weird things will happen a lot, this mod is still balanced around vanilla though, do not expect anything that is overpowered.
This mod is currently very early and this is my first C:DDA mod.

Current mod version - 1.0.1

Confirmed working as of game version - EXP Build c5ae888
