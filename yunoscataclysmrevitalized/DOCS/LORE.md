# Lore.

## Wait, lore? What lore?

To be honest, I wasn't too concerned with adding lore to this mod when I first got started with it, it was mostly just a playaround mod. However, as time has gone on, I've wanted to make this an actual mod that one could play with and seriously enjoy for the content it provides to them. As such, this is the beginning of the lore I've started writing.

If anything here is unclear, you can always ask me! Additionally, I am not the greatest writer in the world, if you have any ideas to improve the stuff you see here, please let me know! I want to include other people in this mod as well, so if you wish to contribute, please do!


## Before the Cataclysm.

### The Timing.
[TO BE REWRITTEN IN THE FUTURE]

### The Magic.
[WIP]
The general gist of what I want here is basically just Magiclysm: Extended. I would like to maybe improve some minor issues I have with Magiclysm's lore and balance, but other than that, the overall system is similar, just expanded.

The relevancy of magic remains the same as it does in Magiclysm, not forgotten, but nobody really cares.

I want to add in a few new magic classes, but we'll see about how that goes.

### XEDRA.
[WIP]
XEDRA is doing more or less the exact same stuff with XE-037 as it was before, except now, with slightly more advanced tech, and of course, the effects of XE-037 as it pertains to magic. 

## The Cataclysm.

### The Start.
The Cataclysm starts in the middle of spring, 2029, immediately, the world is devastated. With billions dead, and many more soon to follow. Some doomsday preppers make it, many do not.

The effects of the Cataclysm have resulted in creatures from other dimensions being capable of jumping to our own, just like in the base game.

Note: I want an otherworldly-type NPC faction, they will be initially friendly to the player, and effectively act as an alternative to Exodii, this will be much later on in development. 


[To be continued when I have the time.]
