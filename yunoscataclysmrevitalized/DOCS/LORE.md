# Lore.

## Wait, lore? What lore?

To be honest, I wasn't too concerned with adding lore to this mod when I first got started with it, it was mostly just a playaround mod. However, as time has gone on, I've wanted to make this an actual mod that one could play with and seriously enjoy for the content it provides to them. As such, this is the beginning of the lore I've started writing.

If anything here is unclear, you can always ask me! Additionally, I am not the greatest writer in the world, if you have any ideas to improve the stuff you see here, please let me know! I want to include other people in this mod as well, so if you wish to contribute, please do!

Small warning: This document does talk briefly about politics as they pertain to this interpretation of the Cataclysm. However, I do not mention any political party by name or any individual by name, and while I do hold slight left-leaning beliefs (some of which certainly shine through), I have tried to keep things mostly realistic, this is not an ideal world, and the Cataclysm has still ruined it beyond repair.

## Before the Cataclysm.

### The Timing.
My interpretation of the world of Cataclysm is one which takes place in a time not too far ahead from our own, 2029. However, the world is different in a number of ways from our own, even before the Cataclysm. Technology, Magic, and "rare creatures" being the prime examples.

The world itself is more comfortable, but not stress free at this moment, foreign tensions are still quite a worrysome endeavor, both for America, and the rest of the world, war is not active, but any vague insult to one or another nation could easily spark a multi-year long major global conflict. 

America itself, though, is doing fine, with a much more stable social atmosphere, and much more acceptance of the people regardless of who they are, so long as they aren't a bad person. Pride is celebrated, and poor neighborhoods have been restructured, having life breathed back into them. The economy is more stable overall, but there are certainly arguments about it amongst people both at the governmental level, and at the civilian level, as there always will be.

Companies still continue to grow rather readily, especially as newer and newer technologies come to the market, more and more people continue to buy them. Though, because it's also easier for new startups to occur as a result of the rapidly emerging changes to the worlds overall capabilities, "monopolies" don't hold quite the same weight as they used to.

### The Technology.
Technology is similar to what we in our own Earth are capable of, *however,* there is a much more progressive mindset on average throughout society as a whole as it relates to the development of advanced technology. If in our world, we would see a split of 80%/20% Gas/Electric vehicles by 2029, in this world, we would see a 35%/65% split instead. This attitude results in these technologies receiving a substantial amount more funding, and thus, much more research, and more development.

As such, the technology that is available in the mod should lean *slightly* more into Sci-Fi than the base game does. Things such as power efficient 1nm processors enable semi-intelligent man-sized robots, and military applications for this technology would be equal to something like extremely advanced AI-Assisted planning.

Weaponry technology is of course a big part of any major advancements that we as humans have made since pretty much the dawn of time. It is no exception here, energy weapons are being consistently developed, however, most of these are considered to be prototypes.

### The Magic.
[WIP]
The general gist of what I want here is basically just Magiclysm: Extended. I would like to maybe improve some minor issues I have with Magiclysm's lore and balance, but other than that, the overall system is similar, just expanded.

The relevancy of magic remains the same as it does in Magiclysm, not forgotten, but nobody really cares.

I want to add in a few new magic classes, but we'll see about how that goes.

### XEDRA.
[WIP]
XEDRA is doing more or less the exact same stuff with XE-037 as it was before, except now, with slightly more advanced tech, and of course, the effects of XE-037 as it pertains to magic. 

## The Cataclysm.

### The Start.
The Cataclysm starts in the middle of spring, 2029, immediately, the world is devastated. With billions dead, and many more soon to follow. Some doomsday preppers make it, many do not.

The effects of the Cataclysm have resulted in creatures from other dimensions being capable of jumping to our own, just like in the base game.

Note: I want an otherworldly-type NPC faction, they will be initially friendly to the player, and effectively act as an alternative to Exodii, this will be much later on in development. 


[To be continued when I have the time.]
